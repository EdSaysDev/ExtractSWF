# ExtractSWF

This is a simple tool to extract SWF files from PPTX files, written in C# .NET, using the .NET Framework. Inspired by [http://blog.interrupt3h.com/?p=250], and specifically the Python port here: [https://pastebin.com/xJY3KJcZ].

It is reliant upon the Windows API Code Pack, found here: [https://github.com/aybe/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1]
